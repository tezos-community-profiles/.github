# Tezos Community Profiles

Welcome!

The Tezos Community Profiles (TCP) project aims to provide a robust and community oriented profile system for the Tezos Blockchain.

It was recently funded by the Tezos Ecosystem DAO üòä üôè ‚ù§Ô∏è 

You can see the proposal [here](https://forum.tezosagora.org/t/open-sourcing-and-decentralizing-tezid-profiles/5681) and on-chain [here](https://tezos-homebase.io/explorer/dao/KT1VA5SvdE9AU41GY4u7ik5WkTi1pMU4PiTz/proposal/ed24a22272dcc584c9ce40dcc94bc5df0a17bc6e100650eb3caccac99481ae0f).

The initial funding will cover the development of a [smart contract](https://github.com/tezos-community-profiles/contracts), [indexer](https://github.com/tezos-community-profiles/indexer) and [API](https://github.com/tezos-community-profiles/api).
These are currently under development!

We want to make this a community oriented project, so feedback is very welcome!  
Please use github issues in the different repos for this.  

We hope you find this project useful!
