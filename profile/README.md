# Tezos Community Profiles

Welcome!

üü£ üü£ üü£

The Tezos Community Profiles (TCP) project aims to provide a robust and community oriented profile system for the Tezos Blockchain.

## Decentralized

TCPs are decentralized. Their data is written to a smart contract and only the private key owners can write their profile data.
The contracts, indexer & API source codes are in the public domain and freely available for any project to use.

## Easy to use

TCP aims to be a "drop-in" profile system. It comes with prebuilt docker images, so if you want to self-host, it's super easy to spin them up on your infrastructure.

[TezID](https://tezid.net) will also host a CORS enabled and publicly available TCP API.

## Community oriented

We want to make this a community oriented project, so feedback, patches, PRs etc. are very welcome!  
We are hoping to expand the project and scope over time and include more developers as active contributors.

## Funding

It was recently funded by the Tezos Ecosystem DAO üòä üôè ‚ù§Ô∏è 

You can see the proposal [here](https://forum.tezosagora.org/t/open-sourcing-and-decentralizing-tezid-profiles/5681) and on-chain [here](https://tezos-homebase.io/explorer/dao/KT1VA5SvdE9AU41GY4u7ik5WkTi1pMU4PiTz/proposal/ed24a22272dcc584c9ce40dcc94bc5df0a17bc6e100650eb3caccac99481ae0f).

The initial funding will cover the development of a [smart contract](https://github.com/tezos-community-profiles/contracts), [indexer](https://github.com/tezos-community-profiles/indexer) and [API](https://github.com/tezos-community-profiles/api).
These are currently under development!

We hope you find this project useful!
